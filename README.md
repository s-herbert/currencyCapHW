I have kept the work under four hours.<br>
I am creating a new branch (refactor) just to clean up some of the code.

Server is started with npm start.

Tests ran with npm test.

Handles incoming requests via query params, e.g.
localhost:1444/banana-budget?startDate=07/01/2018&numberOfDays=7

Includes:<br>
Abstracted routes, and server configuration for scalability!<br>
Added Helmet for extra security!<br>
Simple cache for performance!<br>



Missing:<br>
Error handling for negative numberOfDays input<br>
Integration tests (supertest)<br>
Handling of URL encoded form requests<br>
Banana emojis<br>
